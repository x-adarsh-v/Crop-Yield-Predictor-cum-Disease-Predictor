Agri-AI: Your Smart Farming Assistant 
Farming is tough. You have to be a meteorologist, a biologist, and an economist all at once. We built Agri-AI to make that job a little easier.

This is a simple, all-in-one web app designed to give farmers a helping hand by answering two of their biggest questions: "How much will I harvest?" and "What's wrong with my crops?"

Here's what it can do for you:

1. ðŸŒ¾ Predict Your Yield
No more guessing. Our yield predictor lets you enter your farm's detailsâ€”like your region, soil type, and the crop you're plantingâ€”and get a solid forecast of your potential harvest. This helps you plan your finances and make better decisions for the season.

2. ðŸŒ¿ Instantly Diagnose Plant Diseases
Spotted something strange on a leaf? Just take a picture and upload it. Our app uses a powerful AI to analyze the image and tell you what disease it is, right away.

But it doesn't just stop at the diagnosis. Agri-AI then automatically searches the web for the best, most practical treatment solutions and gives them to you right on the results page. You get the "what" and the "what to do about it" all in one place.
